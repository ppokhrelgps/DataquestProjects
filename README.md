# DataquestProjects
Projects learned from Dataquest
It's about prison breaks and I learned the following:

Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
Analyze the data using Python
Author our first portfolio project in a Jupyter environment (using JupyterLab), to share code and communicate results
Specifically, I was able to answer the following questions:

In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
